# Modules #

do not change whole module configs here.
use design browser to import complex settings
or create presets to choose from

files in those folder are used to overwrite / extend
configFiles from app/default_config to create new base themes

only make small overwrites here if editing via
customizer and design browser is in use!

## Best practice ##
--> create complex designs via template editor and make them available:
      - through design browser
      - import/export Function

--> keep base themes as similar as possible, change only:
      - assets
      - cssVars
      - config/theme files: colors, gradients, theme
